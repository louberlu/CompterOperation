A typical Python project structure can look like this:

my_project/
│
├── my_project/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── module1.py
│   ├── module2.py
│   ├── package1/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── submodule1.py
│   │   ├── submodule2.py
│   ├── package2/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── submodule1.py
│   │   ├── submodule2.py
│
├── tests/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── test_module1.py
│   ├── test_module2.py
│
├── docs/
│
├── setup.py
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
└── .gitignore

- my_project/ at the top level is the root directory of your project.

- The second my_project/ is the actual Python package. Inside this 
directory, you put your source code. The __init__.py file makes Python 
treat this directory as a package.

- main.py is the entry point to your application. This is where you put 
the code to start your application.

- module1.py and module2.py are Python modules. You put your classes, 
functions, etc. in these files.

- package1/ and package2/ are sub-packages. Inside these directories, 
you can put more modules or sub-packages.

- tests/ is where you put all your test code. You can use a library like 
pytest to write tests for your code.

- docs/ is where you put your documentation.

- setup.py is the build script for setuptools. It tells setuptools about 
your package (like its name and version) and what to include in the 
distribution.

- requirements.txt is where you list the dependencies of your project.

- README.md is the file where you put the basic information about your 
project, like what it does and how to install it.

- .gitignore is where you put the names of files or directories that 
you don't want to include in your Git repository.
